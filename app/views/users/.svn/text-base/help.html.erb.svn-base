<h1>Help - Genlighten FAQ</h1>
<br/>

<h3>What is Genlighten.com?</h3>
<p>Genlighten.com connects genealogy enthusiasts like you with skilled local researchers who can help you find the source documents you need to move your research forward – quickly and affordably.  Our network of "Lookup Providers" specializes in fulfilling well-defined requests for specific genealogical records from local repositories in an efficient manner.  In return, they charge a fair but moderate fee to cover both the time and the expense involved in locating the record and providing you with a copy.  The website makes it convenient for you to find a lookup provider, see ratings and feedback on their services, submit your lookup request, and track the provider’s progress.</p>

<h3>Who are your "lookup providers" and what qualifications do they have?</h3>
<p>Our providers are basically people with a passion for genealogy and local history, perhaps much like you.  They range from college age to seventy and beyond.  A few are accredited professional genealogists with many years of full-time research experience on behalf of their clients.  Most are serious amateur genealogists who have gained particular expertise with records repositories in their community and the documents they contain as a result of their own personal family history research.  Many are members and volunteers of local genealogical societies, donating some or all of their lookup fees to help support their society’s efforts.
</p>

<h3>How did Genlighten.com get started?</h3>
<p>Cynthia Richardson, a member of our founding management team, first launched an online genealogy lookup site called ChicagoGenealogy.com in 2003, focusing on Cook County Illinois vital records.  As word of her efficient and reasonably-priced service spread on genealogy message boards, she began to receive e-mails asking if there was a similar site available in other states and counties.  Her husband Dean was motivated by MBA classes in entrepreneurship at the Kellogg School of Management to found Genlighten.com in response to these requests.  Enlightened Research LLC was formed and initial design of the site was begun in August of 2007.  SolutionStream of American Fork, Utah performed the primary development between October 2007 and February 2008.
</p> 

<h3>Are you an online database site like Ancestry.com or WorldVitalRecords.com?</h3>
<p>Genlighten.com is different than these sites in that it does not emphasize direct access to online genealogical record databases or shared family tree information.  Instead, Genlighten complements these sites by helping you track down genealogical documents that are currently available only offline (i.e. on microfilm or in paper form) in local archives and repositories.
</p>

<h3>Do I have to pay a subscription fee to use your site and access your lookup providers?</h3>
<p>Genlighten.com does not charge a subscription fee.  You may browse through the entire list of the lookups we offer at no charge.  You pay only when you decide to submit a lookup request to our providers through our site.  The fee you pay is set by the providers themselves, based on the complexity of the lookup, the time typically required and the providers’ costs (gas, postage, copying, etc.)  We add a handling charge to the provider’s fee to cover payment processing and other site administration expenses.
</p>

<h3>You don’t seem to offer the lookups I need for the counties I’m interested in -- Why is that and what can I do about it?</h3>
<p>In some states, due to privacy restrictions imposed by local governments, certain records may only be available to direct descendants who can prove their relationship to the individual for whom a record is requested.  In such cases, it may not be possible for a lookup provider to obtain the record for you.</p>
<p>In most counties, however, if we don’t offer a lookup, it’s because we haven’t yet found a provider to offer it.  We’re working hard to expand our provider network, and we’re determined to find researchers who can get you the records you need.  To help us do this, you can: Add a provider request to our "Wish List".  Visitors to the site who see your wish list entry may then choose to sign up as providers.  Additionally, our staff will try to use our resources to track down potential providers to fulfill your request. Suggest a potential provider to us (e-mail us at providers@genlighten.com) or encourage them to sign up themselves.
</p>

<h3>How does the "Wish List" work?</h3>
<p>Suppose you’re looking for city directory lookups in Cincinnati for the years 1885-1895, but when you review our list of lookups offered for Hamilton County Ohio you don’t see any city directory lookups offered.  Simply click on the "Wish List" tab at the top of the page.  Using the text box provided, compose a brief note indicating you’re looking for a provider who has access to Cincinnati city directories within the desired years.  You might also suggest a price you’d be willing to pay.  Don’t include specific info about the individuals you are looking for at this point.  If you’d like to be notified by e-mail when a provider responds to your request, click the appropriate checkbox.  When you click "Submit", your request will be added to the wish list.
</p>
<p>As potential providers visit the site, they’ll review the list as they decide what lookups to offer.  When a provider begins offering the lookup you want, you’ll receive a notification e-mail from the site.</p>

<h3>The provider offering the lookup I want hasn’t received any ratings.  How can I know whether they’re reliable and efficient?
</h3>
<p>We work hard to recruit well-qualified providers:  people who understand that their ability to earn income through our site will be determined by the reputation they develop for timely, friendly, reliable service.  As a quality-control measure, Genlighten staff will occasionally act in a "mystery shopper" role and order lookups from our newest providers in order to assess their responsiveness and accuracy.  But the truth is that it’s not practical for us to thoroughly screen every provider.  As a result, you can’t be sure how our providers will perform until you’ve experienced their service for yourself.</p>
<p>Requesting a lookup from a new provider with no previous feedback represents a risk.  You can minimize this risk by limiting your initial purchase to a single, well-defined, moderately-priced request.  Utilizing providers who offer to provide scanned digital images of documents can also help in this regard, since your image should become available on the site within at most a few hours after the provider notifies you that it’s ready.</p>

<h3>What happens if the provider claims they’ve sent my document but I still haven’t received it?  What recourse do I have?</h3>
<p>In our experience, most such delays are the results of two surprisingly frequent occurrences:
<ul>
	<li>The post office takes longer than usual to process and deliver the envelope sent by the provider (in the case of paper documents).</li>
	<li>E-mail notifications from the site (in the case of scanned images) end up in a junk mail folder or are blocked by a spam filter.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t receive your document within a week of the mailing date given by the provider, or the image the provider says they posted isn’t accessible, you should send a polite note to the provider using the messaging interface provided on the lookup’s "Detailed View" page.  Most will be sufficiently mortified (and eager to receive a positive rating from you) that they will promptly provide you with another copy.</p>
<p>If after you’ve exhausted all reasonable efforts to resolve the issue between you and provider you have still not received your record, please contact us at <a href="mailto://support@genlighten.com">support@genlighten.com</a>.  While it is our stated policy not to mediate client-provider disputes, we will do our utmost to get you the record you paid for.  At our discretion, we may also offer you a complete or partial refund. Of course, you should be sure to go to the "Client Detailed View" page for the lookup in question and give detailed feedback regarding the provider’s responsiveness.</p>

<h3>Why don’t you make it easy for clients and providers to exchange e-mail addresses to they can communicate with each other outside of the site?</h3>
<p>This is discussed in both our Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.  Briefly, our goals are to protect our users’ privacy, insulate them from unwanted e-mail correspondence, and help keep their e-mail addresses from being utilized by spammers and others with malicious intent.  Of course, persistent and determined users can find ways around this policy, but we will attempt to enforce it where possible.</p>

<h3>What do the various status codes mean on the "Client Lookup Status" and "Client Detailed View" pages?</h3>
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Submitted:  Submitted lookups are ones for which you’ve provided data and authorized payment through the site, but that the Lookup Provider has yet to formally review and accept.</li>
	<li>In-Process:  When the provider accepts your request, the status code displayed will change from Submitted to In-Process, which indicates that they will soon be visiting their local archive to search for your record.</li>
	<li>Completed:  Once they have successfully obtained a copy of the record you requested (or documented a negative search result) the provider will send you the document in paper form or post in on the site in electronic form depending on the choice you made at checkout.  This code indicates you can expect to receive your record shortly.</li>
	<li>Not Found: If a provider is unable to locate the document you requested, they will select this status code for your lookup and attach a note explaining the negative result.  They may also mail or upload documentation of the record they searched and provider some other helpful documentation [such as the index page they searched without success.]  In such cases, the provider may (but is not obligated to) offer a discount on the fee you originally paid.</li>
	<li>Received:  When your documents arrive (whether in your mailbox or posted on the site) please click the "Received" button on the "Client Detailed View" page so the provider will know that their envelope or image made it to you.  You’ll then be prompted to rate the provider’s efforts and offer specific feedback.</li>
	<li>Cancelled:  If you cancel a lookup (using the "Cancel" button on the "Client Detailed View" page) before the Provider has accepted it and begun work, this status code is displayed.</li>
	<li>Declined:  After reviewing your request, the Lookup Provider may decide that they can’t complete your lookup in a timely fashion given the data you’ve provided, or that your request falls outside the scope of the records they have access to.  If so, they will decline your request and attach a note to the lookup explaining why.  You can view this note on the Detailed Lookup View page by clicking on the description text.  In this case, the provider’s fee for this lookup will be deducted from your order.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Under what circumstances can I "Cancel" a lookup?  Do I still have to pay anything for the lookup if I cancel?
</h3><p>You can cancel a lookup as long as the status displayed for it on the "Client Lookup Status" page is "Submitted".  In this situation, the provider’s fee for that lookup will not be billed to your credit card or bank account.  However, the Genlighten handling charge will still be billed.  This policy protects us against frivolous requests and the credit-card processing charges that result from them.</p>
<p>Once the provider begins work on the lookup (as indicated by the status changing from "Submitted" to "In-Process") you may no longer initiate a request for a refund of the provider’s fee by clicking "Cancel".  However, if you truly no longer want the lookup fulfilled, you can inform the provider by posting a note on the lookup’s "Detailed View" page.  This courtesy will be greatly appreciated by our providers, and, at their discretion, they may discount their fees in this case.</p>

<h3>How do I change the rating or feedback I gave the provider on a completed lookup?</h3>
<p>Find that lookup listed on the "Client Lookup Status" page and click on it to display the "Client Detailed View" page.  Click the "Feedback" button to bring up the rating and feedback text you submitted previously and edit it.  Click "Submit" when you’re finished.</p>

<h3>What does the envelope icon indicate next to a lookup listed on the "Client Lookup Status" page?</h3>
<p>The envelope icon tells you that the provider has sent you a new message regarding this lookup.  Click on the lookup to display the "Client Detailed View" page.  The new message will be the topmost of those listed on the bottom half of the page.
</p>

<h3>How can I remove lookups I’ve cancelled or marked "Received" from the "Client Lookup Status" list?
</h3><p>Use the checkboxes directly above the list to indicate which types of lookups to display.  To stop displaying cancelled or received lookups, just unclick the corresponding checkboxes.  To display them again, just click the checkboxes once more.
</p>

<h3>Why doesn’t the message text I entered display properly in the note I sent to the provider of my lookup?</h3>
<p>The page "validates" the text you enter before posting it to the site.  To prevent the page from breaking and to preserve both client and provider privacy, the validation code looks for any html keywords, e-mail addresses or URLs in the text you type and removes them prior to posting.  Consult our terms of service or privacy pages if you have more detailed questions about our privacy policy.</p>

<h3>Can I delete or edit a message I’ve posted to a lookup’s detailed view?</h3>
<p>Not in the current version of the site, no.  The intent here is to preserve an accurate history of the client-provider dialogue for future reference.  We encourage you to review your message carefully before clicking the "Post Note" button.</p>

<h3>How is the "Genlighten Handling Charge" determined?  What does this charge cover?</h3>
<p>The handling charge is calculated as follows:  $1 for all lookups with provider fees up to $10; $2 for lookups with provider fees up to $20 but more than $10; $3 for lookups with provider fees up to $30 but more than $20; and so forth.  So if you’ve ordered two lookups at a cost of $9 each, the handling charge is $1 each or a total of $2.00.  This charge covers the credit-card or electronic check fees we incur when we process your lookup request.  It also helps offset web hosting, maintenance, and fraud-prevention costs for the site and supports our efforts to recruit qualified lookup providers.  If your lookup fees are subsequently discounted by the provider due to a negative search result or due to copying costs being lower then anticipated, the handling charge will not change.</p>

<h3>How does Genlighten make money?</h3>
<p>We currently charge lookup providers a set percentage of their lookup fee as a commission.  This fee pays for marketing and search optimization efforts that help bring traffic to the site and enhance the income providers earn.  The default percentage we charge our providers is 15%; however, we currently discount this rate to 10% for our founding providers, for providers with particularly high lookup volume, and for providers who donate their fees to the genealogical societies for whom they volunteer.  E-mail us at <a href="mailto://providers@genlighten.com">providers@genlighten.com</a> if you would like to learn more about our revenue-sharing policy.</p>

<h3>I want to become a lookup provider.  How should I decide what lookups to offer?</h3>
<p>This question merits a lengthy, detailed answer, but we’ll try to offer only a brief version here.</p>
<p>Two strategies probably make the most sense, particular when you’re first starting out:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Try to determine which lookups are likely to be most popular, and offer them if those records are available at a library or archive near you.  In our experience, vital records (e.g., copies of death certificates, marriage licenses, etc.) tend to be asked for the most frequently, particularly if they often include parents’ names.  You should also check our "Wish List" for the counties whose records you’re most familiar with.  If our users have already asked for providers to tackle specific lookups in those counties, you know you’ve got at least one likely customer right away.</li>
	<li>Evaluate the genealogical records collection available at your favorite local repository, and decide what unique resources are found there that are unlikely to be found anywhere else.  Then craft a lookup offering around those resources.  An example:  if your local historical society has tombstone transcriptions from an important local cemetery (with an index, ideally), and those records are not already available online, you might do well to offer to search the index and offer copies of the transcriptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you get more comfortable with what kinds of documents potential clients are interested in for your local area, you can consider ordering microfilm copies of those documents for your local family history center’s permanent collection if they are available.  You can then offer lookups that utilize those microfilmed records as a resource.
</p>

<h3>Should I offer a lookup if other providers already offer it?</h3>
<p>There are at least two ways to look at this, depending primarily on the demand for a particular type of lookup in your area.</p><p>On the one hand, if you feel you can provide faster turnaround times or lower prices than are currently offered by others, feel free to create your own offering.  It may take a while for you to build user ratings to the level of existing providers, but with conscientious effort, you should be able to become competitive over time.  This works best in large markets with many requests.</p><p>On the other hand, particularly if the current providers have strongly positive ratings, you might find it to your advantage to carve out your own unique niche and offer a lookup that no one else yet provides.</p><p>In a less-populated county with a smaller number of likely requests, it may not make sense to offer lookups that duplicate those offered by others.  Of course, in such a county, there may be less provider competition to begin with.</p>
<p>Finally, if you are a volunteer for a local genealogical or historical society and plan on having your fees go directly to that society, it’s probably worth your while to offer competitive lookups, even if the prices you charge are higher than those offered by others.  Many potential clients will find your society ties to be an important point of differentiation and may patronize you accordingly.</p>

<h3>
Why do I need to provide the "Brief Explanatory Text" asked for on the "Offer a New Lookup" page?
</h3>
<p>This text (the years covered, what the client will learn, and typical lookup mechanics) will be displayed when a potential client browses through the lookups offered for a particular state and county.  Its basic purpose is to make sure that the lookup request is as well-defined as possible so that the client ends up satisfied and so that providers won’t receive frustrating queries that they can’t complete.
</p>
<p>The year range helps filter out requests you won’t be able to fulfill because the event of interest to the client occurred at a time not covered by available records
</p>
<p>The "What will I learn?" text again serves to set expectations appropriately so the client won’t receive the record only to discover it doesn’t contain the information they hoped it would.
</p>
<p>The fee, turnaround time, and client info text help differentiate your offering from any similar ones offered by other providers, and again serve to set realistic expectations about what clients will receive for their money.
</p>

<h3>
What purpose do the "optional links" serve on my lookup data input form?
</h3>
<p>In many states and counties, online indexes are available that make it convenient for users to find an individual’s name and determine the page number or certificate number associated with the record they’re interested in finding for that individual.  Once they’ve obtained this number, the client can provide it to you so that you can go directly to the requested record on, e.g., a microfilm roll that contains it.  This works well for both client and provider, since:
</p>
<p>The client determines for themselves which index entry is the most likely match to the individual in question, rather than leaving that determination to the provider.
The provider can carry out the lookup with an added level of confidence that they will be able to deliver the document the client desires.
</p>
<p>By providing the link to an index site, you make the lookup process more convenient for both yourself and the client while simultaneously increasing the likelihood of a successful result.
</p>

<h3>
How do I know which of the optional input fields to include in my lookup data input form?
</h3>
<p>The optional text fields are primarily designed to allow you to get the exact information you need from the client to complete the lookup quickly and accurately and no more.  To do this, think through the various steps in the process you’ll go through to fulfill the lookup request.
</p><p>
For example:  how will you know which microfilm or paper record to look at?  Will you need the event year, the individual’s name, the specific city where the event occurred, the newspaper where the obituary was published, or the name of the cemetery to search?  Or can you simply ask the client in your detailed instructions to enter the required info in the "Special Instructions" box?
</p><p>
The simpler you make the form, the less likely that the client will become frustrated entering the data you ask for.  On the other hand, prompting for specific info with specific input boxes can reduce the number of messages you need to exchange with the client to clarify their request.  This can make you more efficient and allow you to make the most of your research time.
</p><p>
These are difficult tradeoffs, but you don’t need to get it perfect right away.  You can tweak the data input form as you gain experience and learn from user feedback what works best.  You can also review the data input forms designed by other providers for their lookups. 
</p>

<h3>
How much should I charge for the lookups I provide?
</h3><p>
A good place to start is probably to ask yourself, "What would I be willing to pay for someone to perform this lookup for me at the level of quality I expect?"  It also helps to look at what other providers are charging for similar lookups to the one you intend to offer.
</p><p>
Another important consideration for some lookups is the amount of uncertainty about the likely outcome of the record search you’re agreeing to perform.  Consider a probate record.  To start with, you may not know if you’ll find a file for the requested individual at all.  If you do find it, you have no way of knowing in advance how many pages you may need to copy (and the postage you’ll need to pay in mailing them.)  Since the site is designed to offer lookups to clients for a fixed fee, paid in advance, how do you price this lookup?
</p><p>
Here’s one approach we would recommend:  break the lookup into individual pieces and offer different lookups for different possible outcomes.  In the probate record example, you could start by charging $6 to determine whether or not a probate record exists for the individual of interest.  If you find it, count the pages.  Then offer lookups for a 1-10 page probate record, an 11-20 page record… up to 41-50, say.  Price them accordingly.  Your client first orders the "Does the record exist?" lookup, and then when you come back with the number of pages, they order the lookup corresponding to that number.
</p><p>
Note that the site allows you to discount the final price of the lookup when you mail it.  So if you priced your probate record lookup at $20, anticipating copying costs of $10, but actually only incurred $8 in copying, you can discount the lookup by $2, and this will be reflected in the final price billed to the client’s credit card or checking account.
</p><p>
It doesn’t work the other way, however.  That is, you can’t tack on a price increase if your copying costs were higher than you expected.  So we encourage you to set your price so as to encompass the upper limit on your expenses.  Then your clients will always be pleasantly surprised if they end up paying slightly less than they anticipated.
</p>

<h3>
What happens if I as a provider can’t find the requested record?  Should I offer a refund of some sort?
</h3><p>
Some lookups will return a negative result, e.g., the individual’s name will not be found in an index, no probate record will exist for them, or no death certificate will appear on the appropriate film pointed to by an index entry.  Though this is a perfectly legitimate result, and highly useful for research purposes, it can naturally be a little disappointing for the lookup client.
</p><p>
To avoid undue client frustration, we encourage providers to carefully design their lookup offering (as expressed in the "Brief Explanatory Text") so that the client receives a clearly-defined "deliverable" whether the search is successful or not.  For example, in the case where the client has asked for an index to be searched and the individual in question does not appear, the provider can promise a copy of the relevant index page as the deliverable. 
</p><p>
To reassure concerned clients that they won’t pay as much if their individual isn’t found, some Lookup Providers will set a "negative result fee" that is lower than their standard fee for the lookup in question.  If despite the provider’s best efforts the search is unsuccessful, the provider will document which records they searched, send the documentation to the client, and discount the price of the original lookup to the lower "negative result fee" (e.g., $5 instead of $8 for an obituary lookup.)
</p><p>
Providers can indicate their willingness to offer the client a discounted price for negative results in their "Brief Explanatory Text".  They are not obligated to do so, however.  Clients should read the provider’s explanatory text carefully before authorizing payment for a lookup request.
</p><p>
If the provider clicks the "Not Found" button on the "Provider Detailed View" page for a specific lookup, they will be prompted to input a reduced fee if they desire.  Any discount will trigger a reduction in the amount owed by the client.  The amount eventually credited to the provider will also be correspondingly reduced.
</p><p>
Please note:  Genlighten is charged an extra fee (currently $0.30) when providers issue discounts.  This fee will be deducted from the amount added to your account balance if you are a provider.
</p>

<h3>
How does your payment process work (for both clients and providers)?
</h3>
<p>Our payment process usually involves four (but sometimes five) basic steps:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Payment authorization by the client</li>
	<li>Billing of client’s credit card or checking account</li>
	<li>Lookup acceptance (or decline) by the provider</li>
	<li>Post-lookup discounting (if necessary)</li>
	<li>Fee remittance from Genlighten to the provider.</li>
</ul>
<p>Payment authorization takes place when the client clicks "Purchase" after having placed one or more lookups in their online cart.  The cost of their lookups (plus the handling charge) is then charged to the client’s credit card or checking account.
</p><p>
Lookup acceptance occurs when the provider accepts the lookup for processing after initially reviewing the lookup request for completeness and accuracy.  If the provider instead declines the lookup, the amount owed by the client is reduced accordingly by the amount of the "Provider Fee".
</p><p>
If a lookup yields a negative result (e.g., an individual’s name does not appear in the record searched) the provider may choose to offer a post-lookup discount (see the answer to the previous question above.)  In this case the amount owed by the client will be reduced by the amount of the discount.  Only some providers offer this option, and they may offer it only for certain lookups.
</p><p>
In some cases, copy costs required for a lookup may be less than originally anticipated.  The provider may choose to discount the lookup accordingly in such situations.  This would again result in a reduction of the amount owed by the client.
</p><p>
The amount earned by the provider for each lookup (i.e., their fee minus the Genlighten commission) is added to the provider’s Genlighten account as clients’ credit cards or bank accounts are charged.  Providers can have their earnings transferred to their personal checking accounts in one of two possible ways:
<ul>
	<li>Genlighten will automatically transfer the provider’s accumulated earnings to the bank account we have on file for the provider at an interval (monthly, quarterly, every six months, etc.) set by the provider on their preferences page.  If the transfer amount is $75 or more, no transfer fee will be charged.  If the transfer amount is smaller than $75, a $0.75 fee will be deducted from the transfer (this is the ACH transfer fee we must pay for all such transfers.)</li>
	<li>The provider may manually direct that their accumulated earnings be immediately transferred to the provider’s bank account at any time they choose.  The ACH transfer fee of $0.75 will be deducted from the amount transferred in this case, even if the transfer amount exceeds $75.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>
Under What Circumstances Should a Provider Decline a Lookup Request?
</h3>
<p>Providers should review each lookup request they receive in order to verify that the client has followed the instructions given them and that they have provided the data needed to perform the lookup.  If the lookup request:</p>
<ul>
	<li>falls outside the year range specified by the provider</li>
	<li>involves a city in a different county than the lookup is intended for</li>
	<li>tries to group multiple lookups into a single request</li>
	<li>is better suited for a different lookup or a different provider</li>
	<li>requires the use of a records repository that is temporarily inaccessible</li>
</ul>
<p>Then the provider should decline it.  The site will prompt the provider to post a note explaining their reasons for not accepting the request.  This note should be thorough and polite, and should include suggestions for how the request could be rephrased and/or redirected to a different lookup or a different provider.
</p>

<h3>
When Should the Provider Mark a Lookup as "Not Found"?
</h3>
<p>Some lookups will return a negative result, e.g., the individual’s name will not be found in an index, no probate record will exist for them, or no death certificate will appear on the appropriate film pointed to by an index entry.  In this case, the provider would signal this result to the client by marking the lookup "Not Found".  When the provider clicks the "Not Found" button on the "Provider Detailed View" page for a specific lookup, they will be prompted to input a reduced fee if they desire.  Any discount will trigger a reduction in the amount owed by the client.  The amount eventually credited to the provider will also be correspondingly reduced.
